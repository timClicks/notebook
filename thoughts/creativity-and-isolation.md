## Creavitiy requires isolation


One of the things that Asimov discusses in his _On Creativity_ essay is that you require isolation to allow new ideas to incubate.

I thnk that this is the same with cultures in general. When cultures are isolatd, they diversge. When they're connected, they converge. 

When ideas are discussed you'll be shaped back into the mainstream. When you're isolated, you can form your own echo chamber.
With critical reflection, those ideas can become more refined with time.

### Side note:

It's fun to think about how blogging used to work. It's almost impossible to find the original essay because of all of the references and cross-references.
