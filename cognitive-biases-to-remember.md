**Baader-Meinhof phenomenon**

We see something repeatedly once our brain thinks that it's important.

From <https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/baader-meinhof-phenomenon.htm>

> “It all started in the comments section of a newspaper called the Minnesota St. Pauls Pioneer Press. During the 90s, one commenter talked about the Baader-Meinhof group, which was a West German terrorist organization, and within hours, he saw another reference to the group 70 years after the organization was disbanded. Hence, the term was coined as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.”

**Gell-Mann Amnesia effect**

We notice journalistic errors about subjects that we know well (which happens all the time) but we seem to think that they're right about topics we know little about.

> “Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them.
> In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.”
