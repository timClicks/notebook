# On the ethics and effectiveness of non-intervention

Europe, and more generally NATO, is currently debating how to respond to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
Russia asserts that this represents a continuation of the war begun (by Ukraine) in 2014.

I've received private messages from Russians arguing that the war is being fourght against neo-nazi Ukraininan nationalists.
Here's one example, responding to me saying that the attacks against civilian infrastructure such as schools and hospitals are war crimes:

> I totally agree with you, civilians should not be affected, but you don't know [Nazis], 
> they enter cities and setup their weapons inside buildings and cities and even hospitals schools. 
> They attacking Donbass russian speaking ukraineans, since 2014 and everyone were silent for 8 year of bombing that region. I
>  have many friends and some relatives from ukraine because I live in moldova it's near ukraine, it's full of refugees now. 
>  What I want to say, if people from west do not know the history of this region and never learned it they can not judge.  
>  Now the whole world is against russia and no one wants to know the reason.


## No no-fly zone

Deciding to rule out a no-fly zone means that Russian aggression can continue.

Is that an ethical decision?

Economic sanctions cause harm. The devaluation of the Russian ruble has itself destroyed the savings.

## Imperialists don't stop

It's rare for those building an empire by conquest to stop peacefully.
Alexander contnued expanding until death
Napolean continued until the French military was destroyed.
The Ottoman empire expanded into Europe until Suleiman I سليمان اول was (1520-1566) was defeated by the Hapsburg empire.
Hilter continued until Berlin had fallen.

Putin appears to be attempting to reclaim territory that was held by Catherine II (1762-1796).

History always relishes in a bitter sense of irony.
Catherine was a Prussian who spoke French built the Russian empire ostensibly based on Enlightenment principles espoused primarily from French.
An anti-enlightment Russian is now attempting to reclaim the empire against French, Germans and others.

- Czechoslovakia | Crimea
- Austria | Donbas
- USA non-intervention | NATO non-intervention
