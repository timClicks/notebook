Mentioned by [Gerhard Lazu in a interview on ShipIt](https://changelog.com/shipit/75):

> I was at a conference recently, it was the Swiss Cloud Native day in Bern… And there was this speaker, Tim McNamara - now, he’s pretty big on Rust. And I learned a few things about Rust which I didn’t know, and I was genuinely impressed with some of those. He blogs, he writes books, he gave talks, and there’s a talk which is recorded, I will put it in the show notes, from the Swiss Cloud Native day in Bern… And he talks about Rust and why there are certain advantages that only Rust has. And Go is great for the majority of things. But knowing what I know about Erlang and Elixir, and Rustler is what I’m thinking for Rust, that integration specifically… I think WhatsApp was involved with it, because they need, at their scale, certain things. And Erlang is not that great when it comes to computationally-intensive tasks. And that’s when you want something which is better. And C is used quite a bit with Erlang, because they have the same heritage… But that can be a bit awkward when it comes to integrating. It does happen, but you need some very specific knowledge, and usually legacy systems do that.
>
> But with the growing popularity of Rust - I mean, shipping in the Linux Kernel itself, that is big. Right? I mean, you can get Rust support in the Linux Kernel… What? I wasn’t expecting that… I think it’s worth checking out. And again, some conversations with Tim, knowing about Rustler… There’s like a lot of hints that Rust is worth exploring, especially at very large scales, where a 10%, a 20% improvement can mean millions of dollars. And that’s when you start seeing the difference, where you say 10%, 20% is not that much different, but at 500,000 users, it makes a big difference. That actually means an extra 100,000. Right? You can do 600,000 for free, with the same resources.
>
> And the memory is a very interesting approach in Rust. There’s no garbage collection, there’s none of that. And for like real-time, it makes a difference when real-time is a priority. So I’m just mentioning it, putting it out there, food for thought. Something which I’ll check out.

> _Data journalism contributor Tim McNamara takes a look at the stats:_
>
> Some definitely have, but not as many as would travel away during an average weekend.
>
> Waka Kotahi, the government agency responsible for maintaining the country's state highway system, has installed traffic counters at various places. By analysing this data, it's possible to get a sense for how people are travelling between regions. One of the counters is just north of Auckland, to the west of Orewa. The counters distinguish between light and heavy vehicles. A light vehicle weighs less than 5 tonnes. When more vehicles travel north than south on the same day, it probably means that someone spent the night up north. Perhaps at their bach in Omaha.
> 
> The chart below shows the counts from each trip. When a day is above 0, a vehicle has left the city for the night. When it's below 0, someone has returned. As you can see, the chart's very jumpy. That's because thousands of cars head away from Auckland on Friday and Saturday, then return home on Monday. Over the course of the week, the population of Auckland breathes. During the summer months, this number grows. The big spikes up and down are holiday weekends.
> 
> So, do people flee to their holiday homes during lockdown? Probably, but fewer than what would happen on a normal weekend. At the start of the first level four lockdown, about 1900 vehicles travelled north. That compares with 3200 the weekend before and is significantly less than 5000 or so during holiday weekends. Many of those 1900 vehicles would have been returning back to their homes after visiting Auckland. But undoubtedly some would have spent a few weeks away from the city.
