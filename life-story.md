> _Data journalism contributor Tim McNamara takes a look at the stats:_
>
> Some definitely have, but not as many as would travel away during an average weekend.
>
> Waka Kotahi, the government agency responsible for maintaining the country's state highway system, has installed traffic counters at various places. By analysing this data, it's possible to get a sense for how people are travelling between regions. One of the counters is just north of Auckland, to the west of Orewa. The counters distinguish between light and heavy vehicles. A light vehicle weighs less than 5 tonnes. When more vehicles travel north than south on the same day, it probably means that someone spent the night up north. Perhaps at their bach in Omaha.
> 
> The chart below shows the counts from each trip. When a day is above 0, a vehicle has left the city for the night. When it's below 0, someone has returned. As you can see, the chart's very jumpy. That's because thousands of cars head away from Auckland on Friday and Saturday, then return home on Monday. Over the course of the week, the population of Auckland breathes. During the summer months, this number grows. The big spikes up and down are holiday weekends.
> 
> So, do people flee to their holiday homes during lockdown? Probably, but fewer than what would happen on a normal weekend. At the start of the first level four lockdown, about 1900 vehicles travelled north. That compares with 3200 the weekend before and is significantly less than 5000 or so during holiday weekends. Many of those 1900 vehicles would have been returning back to their homes after visiting Auckland. But undoubtedly some would have spent a few weeks away from the city.
