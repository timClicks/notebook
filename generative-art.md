## Topics

### Rendering

[Michael Fogelman] has written about [how to render voxels] and has implemented a neat library called [FauxGL] as its basis. To [voxel rendering code] doesn't look too hairy.

[Josh Baker] has created the [`pinhole`] library for programmatically producing wireframe diagrams.
