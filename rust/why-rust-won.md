Why Rust won
============

It's slightly crazy to consider that Rust has achieved the level of success that it has.
It's part of applications that are relied upon on billions such as Android, Chrome, 
Firefox and `curl`. It also sits underneath large cloud services that have a similar
reach including Microsoft Azure, AWS and Dropbox. The prospect of Rust entering the 
Linux kernel becomes more likely every month.

How did this happen? Perhaps most  importantly, how did this happen to a language that 
is **hard to learn** within a  competitive  environment with extremely strong and 
**entrenched incumbents**?


## early factors

- designed in conjunction with real experience in the language (Servo)

## external factors

- underdog mentality (Mozilla vs Google)
- (largely) industry neutral
