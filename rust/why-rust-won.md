Why Rust won
============

It's slightly crazy to consider that Rust has achieved the level of success that it has.
It's part of applications that are relied upon on billions such as Android, Chrome, 
Firefox and `curl`. It also sits underneath large cloud services that have a similar
reach including Microsoft Azure, AWS and Dropbox. The prospect of Rust entering the 
Linux kernel becomes more likely every month.

How did this happen? Perhaps most  importantly, how did this happen to a language that 
is **hard to learn** within a  competitive  environment with extremely strong and 
**entrenched incumbents**?


## design factors

- designed in conjunction with real experience in the language (Servo); early Erlang/OTP was similar
- nothing completely novel in Rust (everything that Rust has was already verified by research)
- big audacious goal&mdash;memory safety without garbage collection&mdash;this is a  controversal point


## developer experience

- impossible to use its assignment operator (`=`) inside of a conditional expression
- pattern matching
- documentation/advocacy (Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols)
- early industry buy-in (Dropbox, many others); developed in the Bay Area where are are many influential developers/companies
- community

## early factors

- humble creator (Graydon Hoare), who yielded on a few key areas (actors) to create something that's focused on systems

## external factors

- underdog mentality (Mozilla vs Google)
- (largely) industry neutral
