Why Rust won
============

It's slightly crazy to consider that Rust has achieved the level of success that it has.
It's part of applications that are relied upon on billions such as Android, Chrome, 
Firefox and `curl`. It also sits underneath large cloud services that have a similar
reach including Microsoft Azure, AWS and Dropbox. The prospect of Rust entering the 
Linux kernel becomes more likely every month.

How did this happen? Perhaps most  importantly, how did this happen to a language that 
is **hard to learn** within a  competitive  environment with extremely strong and 
**entrenched incumbents**?


## design factors

- rust is an amalgam of good ideas
- designed in conjunction with real experience in the language (Servo); early Erlang/OTP was similar
- nothing completely novel in Rust (everything that Rust has was already verified by research)  
  - no nullable pointers
  - result monad
  - maybe monad
  - no null-terminated strings
  - UTF-8 in the type system
  - expression-based
  - memory regions (lifetimes)
  - sum types (tagged unions)
  - affine types (move semantics vs copy semantics)
  - smart/fat pointers
- big audacious goal&mdash;memory safety without garbage collection&mdash;that hasn't been able 
  to be achieved by bolting on safety to other languages. consider [Cyclone], and [MiraclePtr<T>] 

### background: lifetimes

To an assembly programmer, Rust's lifetimes are understood as a guarantee that references to addresses higher in the stack

### background on other projects


**C: cylone**

> Cyclone is a language for C programmers who want to write secure, robust programs. Itâ€™s a dialect of C designed to be safe: free of crashes, buffer overflows, format string attacks, and so on. Careful C programmers can produce safe C programs, but, in practice, many C programs are unsafe. Our goal is to make all Cyclone programs safe, regardless of how carefully they were written. All Cyclone programs must pass a combination of compile-time, link-time, and run-time checks designed to ensure safety.

**C++: miracleptr**

> Chrome's biggest security problem is a constant stream of exploitable (and exploited) Use-after-Frees. Our goal is to stop them being exploitable by turning them from security bugs to non-security crashes or memory leaks.

## developer experience

- impossible to use its assignment operator (`=`) inside of a conditional expression
- pattern matching
- documentation/advocacy (Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols)
- early industry buy-in (Dropbox, many others); developed in the Bay Area where are are many influential developers/companies
- welcoming community; queer-friendly

## early factors

- humble creator (Graydon Hoare), who yielded on a few key areas (actors) to create something that's focused on systems

## external factors

- underdog mentality (Mozilla vs Google)
- (largely) industry neutral
-
