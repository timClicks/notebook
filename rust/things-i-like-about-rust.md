## Quality of life

- Impossible to use an assignment operator inside of a conditional expression

## Relentless focus on the developer experience

### Error messages

The core team has taken the time to [re-label lints](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86717) to make them more accessible.
For example, `disjoint_capture_migration` became `rust_2021_incompatible_closure_captures`.
